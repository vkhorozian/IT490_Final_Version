REGARDING THE GROUPS WORK DISTRIBUTION:

Mendoza (Doza) & Chipman Both brought forth plenty of work in order to complete this project and between the three of us we worked together to complete the current project.

Justin Helped out with as much as he could but I felt that he was slightly un-equipt to manage some of these larger tasks in PHP. He focused on the HTML AND CSS for the website which did come out really nice if i might say.
